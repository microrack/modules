1. pitch/speed frequency
2. fine/FM mode switch
3. fine tune in fine mode, FM amount in FM mode
4. hard sync input/LFO reset
5. FM input (works only in FM mode)
6. V/oct pitch input
7. signal shape modulation (affects only on square and triangle output)
8. signal outputs: saw, triangle, square
9. output mode: bipolar (-5 to +5 V), unipolar (0 to +5 V)
10. shape control (affects only on square and triangle output): for square controls pulse width
11. V/oct tune trim
12. VCO/LFO mode switch
